<h1> FRIES </h1>

<img src="./photos/fries.jpg">

<p> A thin strip of potato, usually cut 3 to 4 inches in length and about 1/4 to 3/8 inches square that are deep fried until they are golden brown and crisp textured on the outside while remaining white and soft on the inside.

<p> Though tastes and preferences differ, the perfect French fry generally has a crunchy exterior and a light, fluffy interior. Finding the right balance is tricky, though, as making French fries that are too crispy will result in a tough exterior that goes beyond crispiness.

<li>2 ½ pounds baking potatoes </li>
<li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil </li>
<li>1 tablespoon white sugar </li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt </li>

</ul>
